# General Practices

- Keep [README.md](mdc:README.md) up to date when introducing changes
  that break documented commands but avoid unnecessary changes.
- Ensure the code you have provided is complete (compiles and tests pass).
- Ensure the code is formatted, if there is a formatting-specific
  configuration in the project.
- Avoid making any formatting changes when not explicitly asked to do so.
- Avoid renaming variables unless explicitly asked to do so.
- When deleting code, avoid writing comments about the deleted code.
- When providing a solution, give me a score on a scale of 1-10 about how
  confident you are in the solution.
